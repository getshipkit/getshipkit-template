# Cognitive Principles in UX

## Cognitive Biases to Consider
- Confirmation bias: Users favor information confirming their beliefs
- Anchoring bias: Users rely heavily on first piece of information
- Bandwagon effect: Users follow what others are doing
- Dunning-Kruger effect: Users overestimate their abilities
- Halo effect: Positive impression in one area affects perception of other areas
- Recency bias: Users remember most recent interactions more vividly
- Serial position effect: Users remember first and last items better
- Baby Duck Syndrome: Users prefer familiar interfaces they learned first

## UX Laws to Apply
- Fitts's Law: Time to target depends on distance and size
  - Make important interactive elements larger
  - Position common actions within easy reach
  - Consider edge and corner placement for easy targeting
  
- Hick's Law: Decision time increases with number of choices
  - Limit options to reduce cognitive load
  - Group related choices together
  - Use progressive disclosure for complex interactions
  
- Jakob's Law: Users spend most time on other sites, expect yours to work similarly
  - Follow established design patterns
  - Don't reinvent standard interactions without good reason
  
- Miller's Law: Average person can hold 7Â±2 items in working memory
  - Chunk information into manageable pieces
  - Don't require users to remember information across screens
  
- Law of Proximity: Objects close together are perceived as related
  - Group related elements visually
  - Use whitespace to create visual separation

## Mental Models
- Align interface with users' existing mental models
- Use familiar metaphors and analogies
- Provide clear conceptual models for novel interfaces
- Account for different mental models across user segments
