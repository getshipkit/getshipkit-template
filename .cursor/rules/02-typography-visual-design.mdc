# Typography and Visual Design

## Typography Best Practices
- Choose font pairings that complement each other (see Google Fonts pairings guide)
- Use no more than 2-3 typefaces in one design
- Establish a clear type hierarchy with distinct sizes for headers, subheaders, and body text
- Ensure adequate line height (1.5x font size for body text)
- Maintain proper line length (45-75 characters per line)
- Use consistent letter spacing and word spacing
- Consider font weight for emphasis instead of color alone
- Test readability on different devices and screen sizes

## Visual Design Elements
- Implement consistent spacing using a grid system
- Apply Gestalt principles for element grouping:
  - Proximity: Group related items
  - Similarity: Similar items are perceived as related
  - Continuity: Elements arranged in a line are perceived as related
  - Closure: Mind fills in incomplete shapes
  - Figure/Ground: Objects distinguished from background
- Use color psychology to convey appropriate emotions
- Maintain sufficient white space for visual breathing room
- Ensure interactive elements have appropriate affordances
- Design for accessibility with adequate color contrast

## Color Usage
- Develop a consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Use color to guide attention and indicate hierarchy
- Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG contrast standards
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Consider cultural implications of color choices
