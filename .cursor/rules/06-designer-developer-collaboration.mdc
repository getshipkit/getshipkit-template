# Designer-Developer Collaboration

## Communication Principles
- Establish shared vocabulary between designers and developers
- Use design systems to create common understanding
- Document design decisions and rationales
- Create explicit handoff processes
- Schedule regular cross-functional meetings
- Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Design Handoff Best Practices
- Provide precise specifications for all UI elements
  - Colors with exact HEX/RGB/HSL values
  - Typography with font family, size, weight, and line height
  - Spacing measurements and layout grids
  - Component states (normal, hover, active, disabled)
  
- Include responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Document component variants and conditions
- Provide animation specifications (timing, easing)
- Include accessibility requirements

## Development Considerations
- Consider technical feasibility early in design process
- Include developers in design reviews
- Create reusable component libraries
- Establish naming conventions that work across disciplines
- Document both ideal and fallback behaviors
- Follow Conway's Law: system design reflects communication structure
- Apply Occam's Razor: prefer simpler solutions with fewer assumptions

## Collaboration Tools
- Design systems and component libraries
- Version control for design assets
- Collaboration platforms with commenting features
- Prototyping tools with code export capabilities
- Documentation that's accessible to both disciplines
