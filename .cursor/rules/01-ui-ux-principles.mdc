# UI/UX Core Principles

## Usability Heuristics
- Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics should guide interface design
- Visibility of system status is critical for user understanding
- Match between system and the real world improves intuition
- User control and freedom prevents user frustration
- Consistency and standards reduce learning curve
- Error prevention is better than error recovery
- Recognition over recall reduces cognitive load
- Flexibility and efficiency accommodates different user types
- Aesthetic and minimalist design focuses user attention
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Provide help and documentation when needed

## Design Principles
- Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Use consistent visual hierarchy
- Implement responsive design for all devices
- Maintain appropriate color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Design for progressive disclosure of complex information
- Keep interface elements consistent across the application
- Apply Fitts's Law for interactive elements (larger targets are easier to hit)
- Use Gestalt principles for visual organization
